## Submission Guidelines

### 1) Make sure you're eligible to participate!

While participating at ETHBerlin is essentially as easy as contributing to an open source project, you have to be physically present and register at Factory Görlitzer Park to participate in ETHBerlin. 

The hackathon registration is at 15:30 of the 7th. If you have not received a message confirming that your application at ethberlin.com was accepted please reach out to joinus@ethberlin.com.

### 2) Form your team

If you don't already have a team, you are welcome to create an issue in the [teambuilding repository](https://github.com/ethberlin-hackathon/ETHBerlin-Teambuilding). 

You can use this issue as a way to get other participants excited about your project or to brainstorm if you haven't yet defined an exact scope.

### 3) Check out the prizes available

Work on your project as you like. How you work is up to you; We recommend creating a new GitHub repo for your team. However, remember to only begin working on your project after the hackathon begins!

As the hackathon draws closer we will start to announce additional prizes in this repository.

Wherever you work, remember that your project should include an **Open Source License** of [some form](https://opensource.org/licenses), and should be accessible to everyone after the submission deadline.

### 4) Start work on the associated Gitcoin bounty

Each prize is set up as a cooperative bounty on Gitcoin, meaning that any number of people can `start work`. 

After you’ve started work, all of your interaction with the prize team can take place on GitHub and in the associated community channel for longer conversations requiring more specific context about your project.

### 5) Submit a pull request 
When you’re happy with what you’ve built you can submit it by creating a pull request on the issue the Gitcoin bounty is associated with. 

If you do not want to apply for any additional prizes, you can simply submit your work to the main prize issue.

You can open a PR before the submission deadline and continue to work, but all materials must be finalized *before* the end of the hackathon. Any commits to your project submission after the deadline will not be considered.

### 6) Congratulate everyone on a job well-done
Whether or not you get a prize, you deserve to be proud of your work. Thanks for participating in the hackathon!
